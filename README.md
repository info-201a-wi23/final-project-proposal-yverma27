## Abstract

The focus of our project is to see how COVID-19 influenced the popularity of various Netflix shows and movies because we would like to see how viewer engagement was during a pandemic and what was trending and valued at that time. To address the question, we will use a dataset containing information about various Netflix shows and movies to analyze their IMDb ratings and see what genres were trending at the time. One thing we need to be mindful of during this project is knowing that IMDb ratings doesn't provide a complete picture of viewer engagement with each content, as this is only one metric to gauge a specific content's popularity. 

No more than three sentences that summarize your project. Focus on the very most important aspects. For example: (1) "Our main question is .... This question is important because .... To address the question, we will ...." (2) "We are concerned with ..., because .... To address this concern, we plan to ...." (3) "Consider that .... This is important because .... Accordingly, we plan to ...."

## Keywords

## Proposal

1. Introduction  

During the Covid-19 pandemic, every aspect of life was different: more people stayed at home, companies shut down, and others thrived. While absolute necessities such as the food and health industries represent some of the most notable high-demand work at the time, overall, many industries presented noticeable differences in production between the years of 2019-2021 regardless of popularity. With this in mind, our group is interested in making observations of how the Covid era may have impacted the popularity of Netflix shows and movies, as lockdown forced many to stay to spend extended time inside. Does the release year of a show or movie affect the popularity (IMDb rating) of the media? Specifically, do shows/movies released from 2019-2021 have higher ratings compared to media released at other times? Do they typically have more votes by the public in general? Were different ratings of movies (PG, MA, R, etc.) more popular during Covid and did a certain group of them receive higher ratings (scores)? What does this say about who was most involved with Netflix consumption and what shows/movies were most popular during the pandemic? Considering Netflix is such a popular streaming platform that not only displays new movies but creates their own Netflix-branded content, we are motivated to delve into such a complex platform. Through this class we have learned the significance of data analysis, and have come to understand that everything is data that can be analyzed. Furthermore, as frequent Netflix users ourselves, we are inspired by what correlations we can observe from data that we use every day and do not typically think about as "data". With normality resuming around the world and streaming platforms becoming more mainstream in general, we find that it is important to understand patterns in popularity of media to accurately form predictions as to what types of content will be best perceived in the future.

2. Related Work  

The streaming platform of Netflix is a staple in many people's lives. With it's diverse selection of TV shows and movies, viewers are able to find content within any genre they are in the mood for. When gathering data, patterns such as type of show/movie and genre can then reflect current trends in society, whether that is what audiences are currently resonating with, or possibly greater representations of what is going on in the world. With Covid, it is harder to decipher what exact genres were popular during lockdown as essentially everyone was at home watching. Hence, the general audience grew. Many articles delve into the driving reasons for this, whether it be because we are missing out on daily activities, or because there are simply less things to do. In a [2020 Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danafeldman/2020/12/10/netflix-allowed-us-to-escape-2020-at-home-in-lockdown-heres-what-the-streamer-says-we-watched/?sh=13ef8a3b1d2d) for instance, the author Dana Feldman expands on this topic as she dissects some of the most notable things that Covid took away from our daily lives. For example, Covid lessened dating and our sense of routine. Feldman then uses theses issues to explain some of the most popular shows that year, such as the rise in popularity of dating shows and the increase in family show viewers. On the other hand, different research focuses more on the cognitive and behavioral tendencies we have as humans that draw us to watching more media. For example, a [study published by the Technology in Society journal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8437809/) analyzes the concept of increased TV viewership due to desire for communication. The authors of this study, a group of researchers from the University of Central Florida, Ohio State, and Cal Poly SLO, explain that humans are social creatures and want to have something to talk about and to connect with others on, which is one reason why we watched more TV during Covid. Finally, a third perspective offered in this work is looking at how Netflix subscription numbers are affected post-pandemic. In a [Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/apr/20/netflix-records-dramatic-slowdown-in-subscribers-as-pandemic-boom-wears-off), the author notes how Netflix subscriptions have dropped dramatically by the middle of 2021. In relation to our intentions for this project, this explains a lot about increased trends in media consumption during the pandemic itself, just as we predicted. This offers an interesting alternative perspective that helps articulate how drastically the pandemic affected Netflix usage.

4. Implications

Data and insights from this project could help technologists as it could inform data scientists and streaming platform developers about the shifts that occur within consumer preferences during times of crisis such as COVID-19. By seeing the trends between release years and content genres with viewer ratings and engagement can help in improving recommendation algorithms. Additionally, these findings could help platforms, such as Netflix, to adapt their content strategies in response to changing viewer engagements. Designers can utilize the insights to upgrade the presentation of various content on streaming platforms. For instance, highlighting popular content from different time periods can help enhance user engagement and satisfaction. Policymakers can benefit by making informed decisions regarding content creation, distribution, and regulation. The insights can help them support the production of content that the audience feels most connected to, especially during challenging times. It can also inform decisions around various media consumption habits and the impact it can have on mental health. Policymakers can implement guidelines in order to promote balanced content consumption habits.

5. Limitations & Challenges

Some challenges that might need to be addressed with our project idea include data quality, knowing the difference between causation and correlation, being mindful of sampling bias, and accurately interpreting ratings. One major challenge includes accessing reliable and extensive data on Netflix shows and movies, which includes information such as viewer demographic, release dates, and IMDb ratings. By having limited access to this kind of data or inaccurate information could make it hard to have an accurate analysis. Additionally, when finding the trends between the release year of a specific content and how popular it was during COVID-19, it's hard to establish causality with that information. This is because there are other factors that could influence viewer ratings and engagement, such as production quality and marketing efforts. A potential limitation that could occur with this project idea is having sampling bias, especially if the dataset consists mostly of well-known Netflix titles. This can result in skewed results, which can limit the generalizability of our analysis to a broader range of content. Lastly, being mindful that IMDb ratings is only one way to gauge viewer popularity and doesn't fully capture the entire spectrum of viewer preferences. Therefore, it's important to include other viewer engagement metrics that can help provide more insights and further strengthen the analysis.
