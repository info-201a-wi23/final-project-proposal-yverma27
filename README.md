## Proposal

1. Introduction  

During the Covid-19 pandemic, every aspect of life was different: more people stayed at home, companies shut down, and others thrived. While absolute necessities such as the food and health industries represent some of the most notable high-demand work at the time, overall, many industries presented noticeable differences in production between the years of 2019-2021 regardless of popularity. With this in mind, our group is interested in making observations of how the Covid era may have impacted the popularity of Netflix shows and movies, as lockdown forced many to stay to spend extended time inside. Does the release year of a show or movie affect the popularity (IMDb rating) of the media? Specifically, do shows/movies released from 2019-2021 have higher ratings compared to media released at other times? Do they typically have more votes by the public in general? Were different ratings of movies (PG, MA, R, etc.) more popular during Covid and did a certain group of them receive higher ratings (scores)? What does this say about who was most involved with Netflix consumption and what shows/movies were most popular during the pandemic? Considering Netflix is such a popular streaming platform that not only displays new movies but creates their own Netflix-branded content, we are motivated to delve into such a complex platform. Through this class we have learned the significance of data analysis, and have come to understand that everything is data that can be analyzed. Furthermore, as frequent Netflix users ourselves, we are inspired by what correlations we can observe from data that we use every day and do not typically think about as "data". With normality resuming around the world and streaming platforms becoming more mainstream in general, we find that it is important to understand patterns in popularity of media to accurately form predictions as to what types of content will be best perceived in the future.
